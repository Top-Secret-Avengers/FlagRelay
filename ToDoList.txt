FlagRelay
Big things coming, github will look better soon.

TODO
Using relative paths for now. Will create a bash script or config exe to set up device IP, answers, hints, etc.

I want everyone to like the styling so I will leave most of that last 

Need cookies placed on login (DONE)

Users should not be able to see the login page if they're already logged in 

App needs to know what flags the players have already submitted (DONE)

Flags should have unique scores

Start script should start the setup ui, then the flask app

Dockerize the application

Figure out how to use the app on the pi

make cookie last at least 1 hour instead of session so users cant break the program 

setup ui needs styling BAD

DEPENDENCIES

User will need to install Tkinter and Flask in setup, I think all PIs come with python but maybe not those modules
