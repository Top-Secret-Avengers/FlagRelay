FlagRelay
Big things coming, github will look better soon.

TODO
Using relative paths for now. Will create a bash script or config exe to set up device IP, answers, hints, etc.

I want everyone to like the styling so I will leave most of that last

Need cookies placed on login (DONE)

Users should not be able to see the login page if they're already logged in

App needs to know what flags the players have already submitted, likely need to create a player class

Flags should have unique scores
